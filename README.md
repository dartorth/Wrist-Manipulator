# The Shah Faria Wrist Manipulator

## Abstract

### 1. Background
Wrist manipulation is a common procedure for reduction of displaced fractures of the distal radius and ulna.  It requires skill and targeted, sequential application of forces to correct a deformity and then application of a direct or indirect stabilising mechanism.  It has several weaknesses.  It relies on operator skill.  It depends on application of using mismatched surfaces (the fingers and palms of the operator to the displaced fracture via the overlying soft tissues of the patient). If performed with image intensifier in theatres, the operator may also be exposed to radiation, with the normal sequence of manipulate, image (while wrist is being held), re-manipulate, image, stabilise, image etc. The reduction forces are then immediately replaced by a construct that cannot (generally) reproduce the force that enabled that reduction.  An externally applied stabilisation construct like a cast, if used, may apply a continuous static pressure of the integument of the patient and potentially lead to local tissue ischaemia related issues.

### 2.  Concept
The SF wrist Manipulator is a robotic device, that can be programmed to apply a sequence of forces, applied via inherently matching surfaces.  The effects of the manipulation can be inmmediately visualsed, whilst the operator is remote from the device. The same device becomes the stabilsation device, maintaining the position it has achieved.  Future manipulations can be again performed using this device if needed.  To achieve conformity (and uniform contact pressures) the devices contact surfaces are fluid (e.g. silicone) filled bladders held within a more rigid frame, to which lockable mechanical (e.g. hydraulic or screw drivven) actuators are attached.  If used as a stabilisation device as well, the pressure within the contacting bladders may be cyclically changed to reduce pressure mentioned, in much the same way alternating pressure mattresses used in hospital patient care.

For the puproses of this project, manipulation of the wrist is conceptualised as a manipulation of a displaced multiplanar (a combination of shortening, rotation, transaltion and angulation) distal radius fracture relative to its proximal end about a intact ulnar strut/column.  This is the configuration of the majority of wrist fractures that would be treated using this particular method. Although clearly this is an over simplification of the diverse patterns of wirst fracture, it forms the basis of this attempt at creating a fracture reduction device.

#### 3. Method

#### 3.1. Collecting background parameters.
During a manipulation in theatres or in ED a pressure pad is used to determine pressure applied to the patientâ€™s surfaces.  This allows the representation of the local pressures experienced by the surfaces during such a manipulation.  This tool then can be used to determine the forces required to produce the corrective to be delivered by the actuators.  The tool will also be used to validate the conjecture that the device will provide a more uniform application of pressure to the patients limb surfaces

#### 3.2. The device: Contact surfaces
Structures contacting the limb distal and proximal to the fracture are designed. Control of the fragments, (as in closed manual manipulation) relies on identifying the areas of the wrist that provde most control of the fragments. As they engage with fracture indirectly through skin and soft tissue the purchase is, by definition, less robust than the purchase obtained by pins into bone. There are several candidate surfaces for contact between device and target offering direct (through association with fracture fragment) and indirect (through ligamentotaxis) opportunities for manipulation.  

#### 3.2.1 Surfaces for device contact proximal to the fracture.
The soft tissues for the foream are bulky and offer poor contact with bony elements of interest, however they do offer a large surface area so this may help to achieve a better purchase.  

#### 3.3
Consideration should be also made for the potential of secondary damage to these soft tissues in the application of the structures. 
A lockable hydraulic or mechanical linear actuator is designed;  The actuators are designed to be lockable progressive with ends that have either one or two planes of freedom at the ends.
