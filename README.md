# The Shah Faria Wrist Manipulator

## Abstract

### 1. Background
Wrist manipulation is a common procedure for reduction of displaced fractures of the distal radius and ulna.  It requires skill and targeted, sequential application of forces to correct a deformity and then application of a direct or indirect stabilising mechanism.  It has several weaknesses.  It relies on operator skill.  It depends on application of using mismatched surfaces (the fingers and palms of the operator to the displaced fracture via the overlying soft tissues of the patient).  The reduction forces are then immediately replaced by a construct that cannot (generally) reproduce the force that enabled that reduction. If performed with image intensifier in theatres, the operator may also be exposed to radiation, with the normal sequence of manipulate, image (while wrist is being held), re-manipulate, image, stabilise, image etc. An externally applied stabilisation construct will apply a continuous static pressure of the integument of the patient and potentially lead to local ischaemia related pressure problems.

### 2.  Concept
The SF wrist Manipulator is a robotic device, that can be programmed to apply a sequence of forces, applied via inherently matching surfaces.  The effects of the manipulation can be inmmediately visualsed, whilst the operator is remote from the device. The same device becomes the stabilsation device, maintaining the position it has achieved.  Future manipulations can be again performed using this device if needed.  To achieve conformity (and uniform contact pressures) the devices contact surfaces are fluid (e.g. silicone) filled bladders held within a more rigid frame, to which lockable mechanical (e.g. hydraulic or screw drivven) actuators are attached.  If used as a stabilisation device as well, the pressure within the contacting bladders may be cyclically changed to reduce pressure mentioned, in much the same way alternating pressure mattresses used in hospital patient care.

### 3. Method

#### 3.1. Collecting background parameters.
During a manipulation in theatres or in ED a pressure pad is used to determine pressure applied to the patientâ€™s surfaces.  This allows the representation of the local pressures experienced by the surfaces during such a manipulation.  This tool then can be used to determine the forces required to produce the corrective to be delivered by the actuators.  The tool will also be used to validate the conjecture that the device will provide a more uniform application of pressure to the patients

#### 3.2. The device
A 3 printed frame is designed with actuator points and chanells for the inflatable bladders.
A lockable hydralic actuator is designed, for the prototype we will be using standard syringes
